           <h2>About us:</h2>
           <p id="desc">JFK is a company established by Jaishree Jaikumar and Muhammad Firdaus Fadlizam.
            The decision to develop this application comes from the fact that we cannot remember everything in our lives.
            Some studies suggest that people tend to forget about 50% of the knowledge they learn after a few hours.
            Likewise, we have a set of tasks that we will be performing daily. Each has a different priority level
            depending on the deadline or how hard it could be. Naturally, we skip over a subset of them due to forgetting.
            <br><br>Hence, our company aims to create an application for users to keep track of the tasks they have to do.
            We prioritize having efficiently-working functionalities rather than focusing too much attention on the
            sophistication of the design and layout. We have implemented a simple and user-friendly UI for the
            users to ensure we adopt inclusivity as people of all groups can use the application with ease.
            Through our application, we would like to provide a platform wherein there are options to add a new task,
            check off tasks that have been completed and delete tasks that are no longer relevant to the user.
            Lastly, we will also consider the creation of an attractive and colorful layout for the application
            to attract users to use the app.
